## Contents
This is where all the documentation for the project will be:

### Brief
The brief provided for this project stated "you required to create a service-orientated architecture for your application, this application must be composed of at least 4 services that work together."

### Additional Requirements
In order to do this, the follwowing is required:
- An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
- A Risk Assessment
- An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built         through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
- If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
- The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
- The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
- As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to     run.
- The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.
